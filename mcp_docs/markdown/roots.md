Understanding roots in MCP

Roots are a concept in MCP that define the boundaries where servers can
operate. They provide a way for clients to inform servers about relevant
resources and their locations.

##

​

What are Roots?

A root is a URI that a client suggests a server should focus on. When a client
connects to a server, it declares which roots the server should work with.
While primarily used for filesystem paths, roots can be any valid URI
including HTTP URLs.

For example, roots could be:

    
    
    file:///home/user/projects/myapp
    https://api.example.com/v1
    

##

​

Why Use Roots?

Roots serve several important purposes:

  1. **Guidance** : They inform servers about relevant resources and locations
  2. **Clarity** : Roots make it clear which resources are part of your workspace
  3. **Organization** : Multiple roots let you work with different resources simultaneously

##

​

How Roots Work

When a client supports roots, it:

  1. Declares the `roots` capability during connection
  2. Provides a list of suggested roots to the server
  3. Notifies the server when roots change (if supported)

While roots are informational and not strictly enforcing, servers should:

  1. Respect the provided roots
  2. Use root URIs to locate and access resources
  3. Prioritize operations within root boundaries

##

​

Common Use Cases

Roots are commonly used to define:

  * Project directories
  * Repository locations
  * API endpoints
  * Configuration locations
  * Resource boundaries

##

​

Best Practices

When working with roots:

  1. Only suggest necessary resources
  2. Use clear, descriptive names for roots
  3. Monitor root accessibility
  4. Handle root changes gracefully

##

​

Example

Here’s how a typical MCP client might expose roots:

    
    
    {
      "roots": [
        {
          "uri": "file:///home/user/projects/frontend",
          "name": "Frontend Repository"
        },
        {
          "uri": "https://api.example.com/v1",
          "name": "API Endpoint"
        }
      ]
    }
    

This configuration suggests the server focus on both a local repository and an
API endpoint while keeping them logically separated.
